## Data Pipelines with Python (video edition)

Welcome to the code repository for [Data Pipelines with Python]()! If you have any questions reach out to @kjam on Twitter or GitHub.

### Code Structure

Most of the code covered in the videos is here; but not all of it. I highly recommend you take time to type out all the code along with the videos and simply use these scripts to "double check" or remind yourself of the work you've already completed.

### Installation

If you are using Python2, use the requirements.txt file. If you are using Python3, use the py3_requirements.txt file. 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

or 

```pip install -r py3_requirements.txt```

### Yahoo Finance API

There is a [good writeup in German for the Finance API](http://brusdeylins.info/tips_and_tricks/yahoo-finance-api/) which I used as a starting point to download newer-time data.

### Python2 v. Python3

This repository is primarily compliant for both versions. Please let me know if you run into any bugs!

### Corrections?

If you find any issues in these code examples, feel free to submit an Issue or Pull Request. I appreciate your input!

### Questions?
